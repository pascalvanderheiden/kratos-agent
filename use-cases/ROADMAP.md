# Kratos use-case roadmap

The goal: one credible persona per major Microsoft industry vertical and every
internal horizontal function — so a Microsoft field SE can grab Kratos and
show any enterprise customer something in their language, with their systems,
in their workflow.

For *how* to build a persona to the bar (the seller test), see
`.copilot/skills/kratos-persona-builder/SKILL.md`. This doc is only about
*what to build next, in what order*.

## Shipped (9)

| Persona | Slot | MCPs |
|---|---|---|
| `generic` | Horizontal · utility | — |
| `wealth-management` | FSI · Wealth | (skills only) |
| `insurance` | FSI · Insurance | (skills only) |
| `retail-banking` | FSI · Banking | `faker` (migrate later) |
| `finance-close` | Internal · Finance | `sap-s4` + `m365-graph` + `workday` |
| `hr-onboarding` | Internal · HR | `workday` + `servicenow` + `m365-graph` |
| `it-service-desk` | Internal · IT Ops | `servicenow` + `workday` + `m365-graph` |
| `sales-account-review` | Internal · Sales | `salesforce` |
| `clinician-visit-prep` | Healthcare | `epic-fhir` |

All nine clear the seller-test bar. Reusable MCPs already in tree:
`workday`, `m365-graph`, `servicenow`, `salesforce`, `sap-s4`,
`core-banking`, `epic-fhir`.

## Target — 20 personas

One credible persona per slot is the north star.

| Slot | Today | Target |
|---|---|---|
| External verticals (Microsoft industry footprint) | 2 / 17 | ≥10 / 17 |
| Internal horizontals | 5 / 9 | 8 / 9 |
| **Total at "one per slot"** | **9 / 20 (45%)** | **20** |

Depth (second/third persona per vertical) is unbounded and lives in Phase D.
Don't open Phase D until the 20 are in.
